## 🚀 Quick Start for New Development

1. **Read `handoff-guide.md`** - Understand what's ready vs what to build
2. **Use `query-3-detailed-authentication.md`** - Implement authentication first
3. **Connect Supabase** - Use existing project with cleaned database  
4. **Reference GitHub repo** - `rudolfs-eglitis/arbor-scan-vault` for implementation patterns
5. **Build incrementally** - Authentication → Tree Assessment → Knowledge Features

The database contains **70+ knowledge sources** and **7,000+ processed content chunks** ready for semantic search, plus complete species and defects reference data.
