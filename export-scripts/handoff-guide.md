# ArborQuant Database Handoff Guide

## 🎯 Project Status
This database has been prepared for fresh project handoff while preserving valuable knowledge content.

## 📊 What's Preserved

### Knowledge Base (Ready to Use)
- **70+ Scientific Sources**: Books, papers, regulatory documents
- **7,000+ Content Chunks**: AI-processed with embeddings for semantic search
- **500+ Images**: Extracted figures with metadata
- **Multi-language Support**: Swedish sources translated to English

### Reference Data (Production Ready)
- **Species Database**: 200+ tree species with growth characteristics
- **Defects Catalog**: QTRA-compliant defect classifications
- **Fungi Database**: Pathogenic fungi with host relationships
- **Site Traits**: Tolerance ratings for urban conditions
- **Climate Zones**: Swedish hardiness zone mappings

### System Infrastructure
- **Row Level Security**: Comprehensive RLS policies
- **User Roles**: Admin, QTRA Arborist, Certified Arborist, User
- **Edge Functions**: AI processing pipeline (OCR, translation, extraction)
- **Storage Buckets**: Configured for images and documents

## 🧹 What's Been Cleaned

### Operational Data (Fresh Start)
- ✅ Test trees and assessments removed
- ✅ Development user accounts cleared
- ✅ Processing queue cleaned
- ✅ Credit transactions reset
- ✅ Audit logs trimmed

### Development Artifacts
- ✅ Orphaned records removed
- ✅ Test data eliminated
- ✅ Only admin account remains

## 🔧 Database Functions Available

### Handoff Summary
```sql
SELECT * FROM get_handoff_summary();
```

### User Management
- `has_role(user_id, role)` - Check user permissions
- `get_user_roles(user_id)` - Get user roles
- `handle_new_user()` - Auto profile creation

### Tree Assessment Support
- `get_trees_with_location_access()` - Location-aware tree queries
- `recommend_species_for_site()` - AI-driven species recommendations

## 🚀 Next Steps for New Project

1. **Connect Supabase**: Use existing project ID `iuwxtoznnuuclxseuxoi`
2. **Implement Authentication**: Role-based system is configured
3. **Build Tree Assessment**: Reference data and RLS ready
4. **Leverage Knowledge Base**: Semantic search capabilities available
5. **Add Real-time Features**: Processing queue infrastructure ready

## 📚 Key Tables for Development

### Core Entities
- `trees` - Tree inventory with GPS coordinates
- `assessments` - QTRA-compliant risk assessments  
- `profiles` - User profiles with display info
- `user_roles` - Role-based access control

### Knowledge System
- `kb_sources` - Source document metadata
- `kb_chunks` - Searchable content with embeddings
- `kb_images` - Visual documentation

### Reference Data
- `species` - Complete species catalog
- `defects` - Structural defect taxonomy
- `fungi` - Pathogenic fungi database

## 🔐 Security Features Ready

- Row Level Security enabled on all tables
- Role-based access control implemented
- Audit logging configured
- Admin user: `rudolfs.eglitis@gmail.com`

## 💡 Development Tips

1. **Reference Implementation**: Use GitHub repo `rudolfs-eglitis/arbor-scan-vault`
2. **Knowledge Search**: Leverage existing embeddings for AI features
3. **Mobile-First**: Design for field assessment use
4. **Swedish Context**: Species data includes Swedish climate zones

The database is production-ready with months of knowledge processing complete. Focus on building the user experience on top of this solid foundation.
