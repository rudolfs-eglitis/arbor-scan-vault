# Query #3: Implement Authentication System with Comprehensive Testing

## Objective
Create a complete role-based authentication system matching ArborQuant's professional arboricultural workflow with proper user management, role hierarchy, and security testing.

## Reference Implementation
Use the GitHub repository `https://github.com/rudolfs-eglitis/arbor-scan-vault` as implementation guide for:
- Authentication components and flows
- Role-based access patterns  
- User interface design consistency
- Security best practices

## Required Authentication Features

### 1. User Registration & Login System
**Implementation Requirements:**
- Email/password authentication via Supabase Auth
- Automatic profile creation on signup with trigger functions
- Email verification workflow (can be disabled for testing)
- Password reset functionality with secure email flow
- Remember me functionality with session persistence

**UI Components to Create:**
- `/auth` page with tabbed interface for login/signup
- Beautiful, professional design matching ArborQuant branding
- Form validation with helpful error messages
- Loading states and success feedback
- Responsive design for mobile field use

### 2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
**Role Hierarchy (from most to least privileged):**
```typescript
enum AppRole {
  admin = 'admin',                      // Full system access, user management
  qtra_arborist = 'qtra_arborist',     // QTRA certified, validates QTRA assessments  
  traq_arborist = 'traq_arborist',     // TRAQ certified, validates TRAQ assessments, AI training
  certified_arborist = 'certified_arborist', // Can perform assessments
  user = 'user'                         // Basic access, view-only for most features
}
```

**Multi-Certification Support:**
- Users can hold multiple certifications simultaneously (e.g., both QTRA and TRAQ)
- Role checking functions support "any of" logic for equivalent privilege levels
- UI displays all user certifications with appropriate badges
- Assessment validation shows methodology-specific options based on user certifications

**Role Capabilities:**
- **Admin**: User management, system configuration, all data access, role assignments
- **QTRA Arborist**: QTRA assessment validation, AI engine training, knowledge base review, tree data access
- **TRAQ Arborist**: TRAQ assessment validation, AI engine training, knowledge base review, tree data access
- **Certified Arborist**: Tree assessments, location data access, own data management  
- **User**: View reference data, basic tree browsing (no location data)

**Methodology-Specific Features:**
- **QTRA Certified**: Can validate assessments using QTRA methodology, access AI training features
- **TRAQ Certified**: Can validate assessments using TRAQ methodology, access AI training features
- **Both Certifications**: Full access to both QTRA and TRAQ validation workflows, comprehensive AI training access

### 3. User Profile Management
**Profile System:**
- Display name, avatar upload, contact information
- Role badges and certification display
- Assessment statistics and activity history
- Professional credentials and qualifications section

**Admin User Management Interface:**
- User list with roles, registration dates, activity status
- Role assignment and modification capabilities
- User activity audit trail
- Bulk user operations for organizations

### 4. Row Level Security (RLS) Implementation
**Database Security Policies:**
- User data isolation (users see only their own data by default)
- Role-based data access (arborists can see related assessment data)
- Location data protection (GPS coordinates only for certified users)
- Audit logging for sensitive operations

**Key RLS Patterns:**
```sql
-- Trees: Users see own trees, arborists see trees they've assessed
-- Assessments: Assessors see own work, validators see assigned work  
-- Profiles: Users see own profile, admins see all for management
-- Knowledge Base: Authenticated users can read, admins can manage
```

### 5. Authentication Context & Hooks
**React Authentication System:**
```typescript
// Custom hooks to implement
useAuth() // Current user, session, auth state
useRoles() // User roles and permissions checking with multi-certification support
useProfile() // User profile data and updates
useUserManagement() // Admin-only user management functions

// Enhanced role checking patterns
hasRole(role) // Check for specific role
hasAnyRole([roles]) // Check for any of multiple roles
hasCertification('qtra' | 'traq') // Check for specific methodology certification
hasEitherCertification() // Check for either QTRA or TRAQ certification
```

**Auth Context Provider:**
- Session persistence across page reloads
- Automatic token refresh handling
- Auth state change listeners
- Route protection and redirection logic

### 6. Protected Route System
**Route Protection Levels:**
- Public routes (landing, auth)
- Authenticated routes (dashboard, basic features)
- Role-protected routes (user management for admins only)
- Feature-gated routes (tree assessment for certified users)

**Implementation Pattern:**
```typescript
// Single role requirement
<ProtectedRoute requiredRole="qtra_arborist">
  <QTRAValidationPage />
</ProtectedRoute>

// Multiple role options (either certification allows access)
<ProtectedRoute requiredRoles={["qtra_arborist", "traq_arborist"]}>
  <AssessmentValidationPage />
</ProtectedRoute>

// Methodology-specific routing
<ProtectedRoute requiredRoles={["qtra_arborist", "traq_arborist"]}>
  <AITrainingInterface />
</ProtectedRoute>
```

## Database Configuration (Already Prepared)

The connected Supabase database already includes:

### Tables Ready for Use:
- `profiles` - User profile information
- `user_roles` - Role assignments with enum constraints
- `auth_attempts` - Security audit logging
- `audit_logs` - Administrative action tracking

### Functions Available:
- `has_role(user_id, role)` - Permission checking
- `get_user_roles(user_id)` - Role retrieval  
- `handle_new_user()` - Auto profile creation trigger
- `prevent_role_escalation()` - Security enforcement

### RLS Policies Configured:
- Profile access control (users see own, admins see all)
- Role management restrictions (prevent self-promotion)
- Audit log access (admin-only viewing)

## Comprehensive Testing Requirements

### 1. Authentication Flow Testing
**Registration Testing:**
- Valid email/password combinations
- Password strength validation
- Email verification process
- Duplicate email handling
- Profile auto-creation verification

**Login Testing:**
- Correct credential authentication
- Invalid credential handling
- Session persistence after page reload
- "Remember me" functionality
- Password reset workflow

### 2. Role-Based Access Testing
**Permission Verification:**
- Each role can access appropriate routes
- Higher roles inherit lower role permissions
- Unauthorized route access properly blocked
- UI elements hidden based on roles
- API calls respect role restrictions

**Role Transition Testing:**
- Admin role assignment works correctly
- Role removal removes access appropriately
- Multiple role assignments handled properly (QTRA + TRAQ combinations)
- Role escalation prevention works
- Multi-certification workflows function correctly
- Methodology-specific features accessible to appropriate users

### 3. Security Testing
**Session Security:**
- Tokens refresh automatically before expiration
- Logout clears all authentication state
- Concurrent session handling
- Auth state synchronization across tabs

**RLS Policy Testing:**
- Users can only access their own data
- Role-based data access works correctly
- Admin bypass capabilities function properly
- Unauthorized database access blocked

### 4. User Management Testing (Admin Features)
**Admin Interface:**
- User list displays correctly with roles
- Role assignment interface works
- User search and filtering functions
- Audit log viewing and filtering
- Bulk operations complete successfully

### 5. Integration Testing
**Component Integration:**
- Auth context provides correct data to components
- Protected routes redirect appropriately
- Role-based UI rendering works
- Form submissions respect authentication state
- Error handling displays user-friendly messages

## Expected Deliverables
